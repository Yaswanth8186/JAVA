Java :

* Java is a object oriented programming language.

* Java files are stored with .java extension.

* Java is a platform independent programming language.

* Java programming language is used for web development, software development.

* During compilation .java file is converted into .class file(byte code).Then JVM(Java Virtual Machine) converts 

  the .class file(byte code) into machine code. 

* JVM identifies the type of microprocessor in the machine or system and converts the .class file into machine 
  
  code that can be understandable by the machine or system.

Introduction to Java :

History of java:

1990 - Sun Microsystem started a project called stealth project to develop a software that can control the 

       electronic devices with the help of a remote. The project is later named as green project.

1991 - Bill joy, James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, Patrik K Naughton and others worked for the project. Initially, 

	     they thought that C or C++ can be used for the project.

     - Later they found that C or C++ can be used for specified device only. They decided to develop the 

	     programming language that will work on all devices.
	
     - They named this project as 'Oak'. But this name is already used by some other company. They renamed the 
	
	     project as 'Java'.

     - They choosed the name Java because during the project development time they used to consumed a lot of 

       coffee.

     - The coffee seeds are produced in Java Island. So, they choosed the name as Java.

1996 - JDK 1.0 released
